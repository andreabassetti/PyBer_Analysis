# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to work together with Omar to deliver a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. The final product should also include a line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The results from the analysis can be looked at in two formats. The first is a table summarizing the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The seconds in a line graph of total fares by week. 
From the table we can conclude the below statements:
- Urban areas have the highest number of total rides and drivers
- The average fare per ride is highest for rural areas and lowest for urban areas
- The average fare per driver is highest for rural areas and lowest for urban areas
